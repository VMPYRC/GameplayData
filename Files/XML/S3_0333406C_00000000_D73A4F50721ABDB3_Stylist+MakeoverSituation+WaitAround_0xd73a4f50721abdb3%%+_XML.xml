This is a fail-safe in case the customer is doing something higher-priority than the 'go to lot' interaction that's pushed on them.  If this time duration is reached and the customer is still not on the makeover Lot then we'll kill the Job and display the 'sorry i have to cancel my makeover appointment' TNS message so that the Player isn't left waiting forever for a preoccupied customer.-->
