      <!--Range:  Motive value.  Description:  If a Sim eats an object that wasn't the same object that caused the Sim to be full and the Sim is greater than this motive value when he/she starts eating, then he/she will get the Stuffed buff.  If a Sim eats half a turkey, gets full, and eats the rest of the turkey we do not add the Stuffed buff.  If a Sim eats half a turkey then half a jelly sandwich, then we do add the Stuffed buff.-->
