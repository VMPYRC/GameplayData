      <!--Range:  Interactions.  Description:  Number of interactions to consider putting in the trait shortcut menu - not all of the interactions will pass the test(), so this isn't the same as the number that actually get put in the pie menu.  I recommend tuning this to a high number because many interactions advertising could test out.-->
