If an object fulfills a need that the Sim has (i.e. above this threshold) then they will be hard-coded to react positively (assuming a good thing happened to the object, or react negatively if bad thing happened to the object).  This number is a normalized value of the difference between the current value of a Sim's motive and the max value of that motive.  Important: this value depends on the shape of the motive curves for each motive (so if a motive curve doesn't dip very low at its min y value then it's possible that motive can never be low enough to pass this threshold, thus that motive can never trigger this short circuit reaction).-->
